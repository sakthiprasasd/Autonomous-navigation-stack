Requirement,Point Value,Page #,"Pos. in page R/L,T/M/B",,,"Instructions: please make a copy of this sheet, naming it the same as your botlab report. Then proceed through the listed requirements and tell us which page the answer to that requirement appears in, and which position in that page that item is on: Right/Left column, Top/Middle/Bottom of column. Also record your section number for that requirement response. If you responded in an appendix, use A,B,C... for appendix numbers even if you gave a numerical section number to your appendix. Finally, submit the link to your sheet, with sharing set to view-only. Also save the file as requirements.csv and submit it with your report."

"Introduction: Describe the Mbot, and provide some background for why a robot with the capabilities of an Mbot are important. Additionally, motivate why each of the components of a functional Mbot are important (e.g. motor control, SLAM)",10,,,,,
Methods: Provide sufficient detail so that an individual with no prior knowledge of your project could reasonably recreate your Mbot (given enough time),10,,,,,
"Results: Provide results that adequately describe the performance of your Mbot. Additionally, for any figure make sure that the figure is clean, the text is large enough to read if the page was printed out, and that all axes are labled with units.",15,,,,,
"Discussion & Conclusion: Discuss the performance of various components of your Mbot, as well as your performance in the competition. Include discussion of what features could be improved, or what features you would add if you had more time",15,,,,,
